## Project Evolution

### Step 1: All routes in app.js
Initially, I defined all routes inside app.js. As the application grew,
this made the file hard to read and maintain.

### Step 2: Routes folder
I separated routes into different files:
- campgroundroutes.js
- reviewroutes.js
- authroutes.js

This improved readability and modularity.

### Step 3: Controllers
To further improve separation of concerns, I moved route logic into
controllers. Routes now only define endpoints, while controllers handle
business logic.

This makes the code:
- Easier to test
- Easier to debug
- Easier to scale
