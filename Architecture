## Architecture Decisions

### Why MVC?
I used the MVC pattern to separate concerns:
- Models handle data
- Views handle UI
- Controllers handle logic

This improves maintainability and scalability.

### Why Middleware?
Middleware is used for:
- Authentication checks
- Validation
- Error handling

This avoids code duplication.

### Multiple Images
Ideally it is not good to store images in mongoDB.So if a user want to upload any images i.e., more than one image for a campground, cloud is better.
Initially using Cloudinary for simplicity.
**Later migrating to AWS S3 to understand cloud storage.**

### Map Rendering on Campground Show Page

The map on the campground show page is rendered using MapTiler SDK with a combination of EJS (server-side) and client-side JavaScript.

The server renders the EJS template and injects required data (campground object and MapTiler API key) into a <script> tag.

These values become global variables in the browser.

An external JavaScript file (showPageMap.js) accesses these variables to initialize the map and marker.

The map is attached to the <div id="map"></div> once the DOM is loaded.

This separation allows secure server-side data handling while keeping map logic modular and browser-specific.
